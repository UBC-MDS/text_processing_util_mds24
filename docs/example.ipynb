    "\n",
    "This package, `text_processing_util_mds24`, includes four functions for processing and representing text data for machine learning tasks, specifically natural language processing. It provides three different functions for text representations that take a list of documents in the form of raw text: `frequency_vectorizer`, `tfidf_vectorizer` and `tokenizer_padding`. If users wish to represent text in another way, `text_clean` will make their lives easier by converting all characters to lower case, removing all punctuations and numbers, and splitting each document into a list of words. Examples on how to use these functions are documented on this page."
